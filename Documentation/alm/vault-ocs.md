# Vault Open Cloud Service

Tectonic's Vault Open Cloud Service provides a one-click, fully managed Vault Secret Management Service on-top of a Tectonic cluster.

* **Secure by Default:** Hands-free automated creation of TLS certificates between all components ensure all best practices are followed for secret security. Further, unseal operations are easy via the API.
* **Highly available:** Multiple instances of Vault are clustered together via an etcd backend and secured.
* **Safe Upgrades:** Rolling out a new Vault version is as easy as updating the Vault Cluster definition; everything is automatically handled using Vault best practices while pausing for unseal tokens.

## Deploying Vault OCS

Use Tectonic Console to enable Vault OCS for selected namespaces. For more information on enabling the Vault OCS and creating instances, see [Working with Open Cloud Services][using-ocs].

Creating the Vault Service will automatically generate TLS certs for the Service, and create and deploy a supporting etcd cluster. It will create two Vault Pods, and a Service routing to them.

By default, objects created using the Vault OCS will be labeled `app=vault`.

Using the Vault Open Cloud Service to deploy a Vault instance will create the following Kubernetes objects:
* A Vault CRD
* 2 Pod Vault Deployment
* A Vault Replica Set
* A Vault Service of type: Cluster IP
* A Vault Config Map
* A Vault client and server TLS Secret
* An etcd client, peer, and server TLS Secret
* An etcd server TLS

## Initializing and Unsealing

Once instances are deployed, use kubectl and the [Vault Commands (CLI)][vault-cli] tool to initialize the instance, obtain the keys, and unseal the cluster.

### Proxy the Vault instance to your laptop

```
$ kubectl -n default get vault example -o jsonpath='{.status.nodes.sealed[0]}' | xargs -0 -I {} kubectl -n default port-forward {} 8200
```

### Point the vault CLI to the local endpoint

Because communication passes over localhost through a secured tunnel, verification may be skipped.

```
$ export VAULT_SKIP_VERIFY="true"
$ export VAULT_ADDR='https://localhost:8200'
```

### Use the Vault CLI tools to initialize the cluster

The initialization flow generates key material that is used to securely unseal the cluster. A cluster is sealed when it is first created, or when the master encryption keys are released from memory, typically due to a restart. To unseal the cluster, provide the generated keys.

```
$ vault init -key-shares=1 -key-threshold=1
Unseal Key 1: <string>
Initial Root Token: <string>

Vault initialized with 1 keys and a key threshold of 1. Please
securely distribute the above keys. When the vault is re-sealed,
restarted, or stopped, you must provide at least 1 of these keys
to unseal it again.

Vault does not store the master key. Without at least 1 keys,
your vault will remain permanently sealed.
```

### Unseal

Use the Unseal Key returned from `vault init` to unseal the cluster.

```
$ vault unseal
Key (will be hidden):
Sealed: false
Key Shares: 1
Key Threshold: 1
Unseal Progress: 0
Unseal Nonce:
```

The first node unsealed in a multi-node Vault cluster will become the active node. The active node holds the leader election lock. The other unsealed nodes become standbys with the status of `Running` but condition of `ContainersNotReady` until they need to take over.

### Repeat for each Vault instance

Repeat the unseal process by port-forwarding to each instance listed as sealed. This will make them available for failover if the active instance fails.

```
$ kubectl -n default get vault example -o jsonpath='{.status.sealedNodes}'
```

## Working with Kubernetes Services and Secrets

Use the Vault Serviceâ€™s YAML manifest to obtain the clientSecret and serverSecret required to expose the Vault instance to your apps.
